A prominence is a large, bright, gaseous feature extending outward from the
surface of the Sun, often in a loop shape. Prominences are anchored to the
surface of the Sun in the photosphere, and extend outwards into the
corona. While the corona consists of extremely hot ionized gases, known as
plasma, which do not emit much visible light, prominences contain much cooler
plasma, similar in composition to that of the chromosphere. The prominence
plasma is typically a hundred times cooler and denser than the coronal plasma. A
prominence forms over timescales of about a day, and prominences may persist in
the corona for several weeks or months. Some prominences break apart and may
then give rise to coronal mass ejections. Scientists are currently researching
how and why prominences are formed.
